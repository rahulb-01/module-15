# Ex.No:9D Heap Tree

## Aim
To write a Python program to build a heap tree using appropriate Python package and function.


## Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Import the `heapq` module.
3. Define a function `heaptree()` that takes a list `H` as input.
4. Use `heapq.heapify(H)` to convert the list into a valid heap (min-heap).
5. Print the created heap.
6. End the program.


## Program

```
import heapq
def heaptree(l):
    heapq.heapify(l)
    print("The created Heap is",l)
```

## RESULT
Thus, the task has been completed to build heap tree using appropriate Python package and function and successfully verified.
